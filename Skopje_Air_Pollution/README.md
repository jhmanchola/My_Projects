# Skopje Air Pollution
This project uses a dataset on air pollution for the city of Skopje, North Macedonia, that measures the hourly particle concentration in the air, expanding from the year 2008 to 2018. This project focuses on the time period concerning the winter seasons of the years between 2013 and 2018. The project aims to answer the following questions:

- Which have been the top 3 worst months overall?
- Which measuring station has the highest ratings on average?
- Make a pie chart with the average rating for each station
- Which is the worst month per measuring station on average? Is it the same for them all?
- Make a horizontal bar chart showing how many days in total the measurements have been over 50 for each.
- Same chart for over 200.

Pollution here is measured in PM10, or 10 micrograms per cubic meter.
