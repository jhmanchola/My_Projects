## Analyzing NYC High School Data

This project is about ranking New York City High Schools by their SAT average score and analyzing which variables can contribute to some schools doing better than others. Some preprocessing was done to clean the data and making it easier to manipulate. Six datasets were joined together to handle all relevant variables. The datasets used were:

    ap_2010.csv: The Advanced Placement exam results for each high school.
    class_size.csv: The class size for each school.
    demographics.csv: The different demographic groups attending each school.
    graduation.csv: Percentage of students graduating from each school.
    hs_directory.csv: School attendance.
    sat_results.csv: SAT scores for each high school in New York City.

Additionally, two survey datasets, survey_all.txt and survey_d75.txt were used to assemble the school evaluations done by teachers, parents and students.

This project is divided in two parts: __Section 1__ aims to join all this information together until we can reach the step in __Section 2__ were we can start making correlations and plots.
